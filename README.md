# SpringPerson-demo

This is a tutorial project based on the following source: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtPkZShrvXQ&t=2457s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

The project uses Spring to implement a REST Controller so that a client can communicate with a server 
and communicate information about "Person" objects from both an in-memory and a PostgreSQL database. 
The client was simulated using Postman.
